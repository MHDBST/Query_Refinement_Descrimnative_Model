# Query_Refinement_Descrimnative_Model
This project is a query refinement model implementing this papaer: Guo, Jiafeng, et al. "A unified and discriminative model for query refinement." Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval. ACM, 2008.

For the language model, I use all-train.txt file and extracted unigrams and bigrams.
